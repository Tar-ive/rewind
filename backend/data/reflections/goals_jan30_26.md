### 1. What would you like to learn during this internship?

- **Architecting Scalable Systems:** I aim to learn how to build reliable, sustainable systems that provide genuine value to a large user base. This includes refining my ability to identify user pain points and assess where the solutions I build will have the most impact. 
- **Team Dynamics and Professionalism:** I want to cultivate the ability to work consciously and effectively within a team. Being conscious about building strong personal connections while maintaining a high standard of professional conduct.
- **Code Craftsmanship:** I am committed to building a daily habit of improving my software quality, ensuring that every contribution is a step up from the last. I want to get better at spotting my own development patterns, self reflecting on concepts that feel natural, challenging and unachievable (while also trying to understand why they feel unachievable)  
- **Agile Methodology and Feedback Loops:** I hope to master the practice of "shipping often" and proactively seeking feedback, adhering to Agile principles to ensure iterative growth.
- **Systems Robustness:** I want to gain hands-on experience with stress testing, benchmarking, and the specific procedures required to make systems robust enough to handle 100,000 concurrent users. 

### 2. What would you prefer to avoid or are concerned about?

- **Burnout and Output Consistency:** I want to be mindful of self-regulating my hours and maintaining a high quality of output, especially in environments where a decline in work quality might not be immediately communicated due to the nature of my work being remote. 
- **Over-reliance on AI and Technical Debt:** I am concerned about the temptation to use AI to meet tight deadlines at the expense of deep understanding, which can lead to significant technical debt. 
- **Losing Sight of Fundamentals:** As I work at higher levels of abstraction (optimizing RAG pipelines and fine-tuning APIs) I want to ensure I maintain a grounded understanding of the core engineering principles and how my work integrates with the broader team’s efforts.
- **Technical Tunnel Vision:** I want to avoid over-prioritizing "nitty-gritty" technical details at the cost of the startup’s broader strategic and tactical objectives.

### 3. How do you plan to communicate effectively with your supervisor and team?

- **Multichannel Engagement:** I will utilize Slack for async updates, participate actively in daily standups, and make the most of scheduled one-on-one calls for deeper alignment.
- **Situational Awareness in Communication:** I aim to develop better "situational awareness" learning to read when colleagues are most receptive to giving or receiving feedback.
- **Constructive Persistence:** I plan to be persistent and regular in my requests for feedback, ensuring I do so in a polite, professional, and non-intrusive manner.

### 4. What potential obstacles do you anticipate, and how do you plan to overcome them?

- **Aligning Individual and Company Priorities:** I anticipate the challenge of balancing personal expectations with company needs. I plan to overcome this by practicing rigorous self-assessment and maintaining transparent communication with people at my startup, school and my girlfriend,  to ensure my "deep work" is directed toward the highest-value tasks.
- **Life Balance:** I want to be more proactive about managing the intersection of my academic responsibilities, professional commitments, and personal relationships (family, friends, and girlfriend) to ensure long-term sustainability.
