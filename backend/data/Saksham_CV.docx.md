**Co-Author**,*“Exploring rural women’s healthcare access through social vulnerability profiles: A cluster analysis of regional survey data in Texas”*			  
•  Developed a novel vulnerability profiling framework using unsupervised machine learning that identified 7 distinct subgroups of rural women; demonstrated that these AI-derived profiles were stronger predictors of healthcare access than traditional demographic factors like race or insurance status.  
•  Engineered and deployed an end-to-end clustering pipeline in Python (scikit-learn) by systematically evaluating four algorithms (K-means, Hierarchical, GMM, Spectral) to identify the most robust model, achieving exceptional cluster validation scores (Silhouette Score: 0.93, ARI: 1.0).  
•  Integrated and visualized multidimensional data by developing geospatial maps of social determinants with ArcGIS Pro and generating 3D scatter plots in Python to illustrate cluster separation and demographic distributions.  
• The insights published in this paper helped activation programs in the rural counties where we identified severe vulnerability.   
**Lead-Author**,*“QuantaFold: Scaling Protein Language Model Fine-tuning to 5000 Families Through Systematic Optimization “*  
•  Engineered  a systematic HPC optimization [pipeline](https://github.com/Tar-ive/protein-DL) that transformed training failures (19+ hour projected) into more optimized training runs for protein language models, achieving 78% training time reduction while scaling [ESM-2](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade2574) (Meta AI) fine-tuning to 400,000 sequences across 5,000 protein families using the [pfam](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33125078/) dataset released by Google.  
• Developed an intelligent data curation strategy using stratified sampling that reduced dataset size by 3.3x (1.34M → 400K sequences) while preserving statistical diversity across all protein families, enabling feasible training without sacrificing biological representation or model generalizability.  
• Validated optimization impact through comprehensive W\&B monitoring, demonstrating 97.9% accuracy on specialist tasks (1.26 hours) and 60.32% accuracy on generalist classification (4.17 hours), with production deployment achieving 63.914 samples/second inference throughput; research findings selected for poster presentation at SC25 (International Conference for High Performance Computing).
